h2. Problem description

Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive).

If the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Buzz.

h2. Running dependencies

You need to install "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/. I'm using "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ to manage gemsets, but it is not required. After install bundle, go to project root directory and type:

<pre>
    bundle install
</pre>

h3. Executing the code

Go to project root directory and type:

<pre>
    ruby lib/fizzbuzz.rb
</pre>

h3. Running the tests

Just type:

<pre>rake</pre>

That's all, folks.
